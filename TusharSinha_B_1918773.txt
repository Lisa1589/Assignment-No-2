Q1.  Why is DevOps a major requirement in Today's Scenario? 
Ans. DevOps—the amalgamation of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams—is an 
     organizational approach that enables faster development of applications and easier 
     maintenance of existing deployments. By enabling organizations to create stronger bonds 
     between Dev, Ops and other stakeholders in the company, DevOps promotes shorter, more 
     controllable iterations through the adoption of best practices, automation and new tools. 
     DevOps is not a technology per se, but it covers everything from the organisation to culture, 
     processes and tooling. Initial steps usually include Continuous integration and continuous 
     delivery (CI/CD), real-time monitoring, incident response systems and collaboration platforms.
