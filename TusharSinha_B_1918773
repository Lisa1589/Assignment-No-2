Q1. 
Ans. DevOps—the amalgamation of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams—is an organizational approach that enables faster development of applications and easier 
     maintenance of existing deployments. By enabling organizations to create stronger bonds between Dev, Ops and other stakeholders in the company, DevOps promotes 
     shorter, more controllable iterations through the adoption of best practices, automation and new tools. DevOps is not a technology per SE, but it covers everything 
     from the organisation to culture, processes and tooling. Initial steps usually include Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), real-time monitoring, 
     incident response systems and collaboration platforms.
